# Efficient-Object-Detection-through-Grasp-Intention
Master Thesis Repository

This repository contains Source Code for the Master Thesis "Efficient Object Detection through Grasp Intention". 
The thesis is written in the Embedded Systems Group of the University of Freiburg.

The Ccde is free to use without any restrictions.

Folders contain different scripts, programs, models, and a example log file set. 

Matlab scripts are written for the version R2012a. For newer versions slight variations have to be done. 
Sadly, there is no interoperability.

Microcontroller Code of the Object Detector is written for the RFduino.

Forearm Sensor Communication is written for the Myo from Thalmic Labs.

The case is modelled with OpenSCAD.
